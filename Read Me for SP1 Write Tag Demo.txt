Before using the demo application make sure the host device and the SP1 have been paired using the "SP1 Target Setting" application provided by DENSO WAVE.

After the application has been started, it waits for the SP1 to connect.

If it does not connect make sure the SP1 is in pairing mode and that it is in Bluetooth master mode.

To test this application follow the below steps:

Press the "READ TAG" button and then press the trigger of the SP1 to read the tag right in front of the antenna.
Modify the data in the new tag data field.
Press the "WRITE TAG" button and then the trigger key to write the new data to the tag.
